                          this game we used Scratch in order to make this. For our project, we 
                          made many changes along the way. For example, instead of multiple levels, 
                          we were going to have just one forever going level but instead decided to code
                          and put together different backgrounds and make different characters act the same as
                          all the others. In Addition to that, we added bonus points for the player to collect.
                          Depending on what items you collected, at the end, you'll get a different ending. </h4>

                            <h4>This is one of my first ever projects I have worked on. 
                            For this app, we used a program that allowed us to work and 
                            add features to a game. During this time my partner and I came 
                            up with many features to add on. For example, we had wanted to add
                            different color mole, or more animals that if were hit you'd end
                            up losing a certain amount of points. Although the idea wasn't 
                            able to become one of our features we had made many more. Some 
                            of them were, timer, sound effects and background music, rest, 
                            stop, and go button.</h4>

                            and I decided to make a round border that was had a thickness to cover the 
                            corners and made it all black. We were able to make different 'filters' or colors
                            but thought the black was simple and the best choice. Soon we added a photo to make
                            the symbol but we use a trumpet because it had a transparent background and was a 
                            universal symbol.</h4>

                            <h4 align= "left"> The winch system is composed of a simple and compound gear train.
                            Both are powered by an FT Motor and a 7.96 V power source. 
                            The systemâ€™s movement can be powered on and off through the use of an FT switch. 
                            First, the small gear in the FT motor is meshed to a red FT gear, creating 
                            a simple gear train. This red gear is put onto an axle which it shares with the winch 
                            drum. The red, circular plates on the sides of the drum had holes going around the 
                            circumference and therefore our group decided to put short poles through these holes 
                            to create a cylinder shape, mimicking a larger drum. Tied onto one of these poles 
                            is a double-strand piece of string -- portraying a cord in an actual winch 
                            -- attached to a 180-gram weight which is reeled in as the winch rotates. To theoretically 
                            test the measurements we used, NetLogo programming to determine the voltage, current, and the mass,
                            if we increased or decreased drum size.</h4>
